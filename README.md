# LDIF_Generator
Tool to quickly generate a bunch of users to be imported into an LDAP Directory for testing or development

It drove me crazy that there isn't a simple utility to generate sample users for an LDAP directory. There is a Java GUI that can do it, but it's very old and, you know,  java ðŸ˜¬. I needed a bunch of users for a project I'm working on at work, so I whipped up a quick utility in Python.

Depends on python-ldap.
